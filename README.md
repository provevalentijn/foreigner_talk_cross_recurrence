# foreigner_talk_cross_recurrence

If alignment is what makes conversation easy (cf. Pickering and Garrod 2004, 2021), in our contribution, we check whether alignment is a structural part of the so-called foreigner talk register (Ferguson, 1975). Foreigner talk refers to attempts made by native speakers (NS) to adapt their communicative behaviour to non-native speakers (NNS). Such adaptations do not only include typical forms of linguistic simplification, but also the use of larger, longer and more transparent gestures (Tellier et al., 2021). One specific hypothesis in the foreigner talk literature is that NS mimic communicative strategies of NNS to improve communicative efficiency (Snow et al., 1981). 

Based on a video corpus of spontaneous speech (Authors 2021, 48 NS-NS and 48 NS-NNS pairs, within-subject conditions), we investigate whether gestural alignment occurs significantly more often in NS-NNS interactions compared to NS-NS  interactions. We annotated gesture functions using both the Neuroges (Lausberg) and M3D (Rohrer et al. 2021) coding systems. We also extracted two-dimensional movement data using the OpenPose framework for pose estimation (Cao et al. 2017) to calculate different kinematic measures in terms of gesture timing, size and velocity. Moreover, we obtained data on social liking by means of standardized social attraction scales (McCrosky et al 2006).

So far, all of the annotation work has been completed but no results can be presented because the alignment analyses still have to be carried out. We expect to find more gestural alignment in the NS-NSS conversations compared to NS-NS both on a formal (kinematic) and a functional level.  If alignment occurs more often, we also expect to see an increase in social attraction. That finding would corroborate the link between alignment and rapport.
